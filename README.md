Project: ALAB DOM Manipulation – Just Like Magic, but With Code

Overview:
In this project, I took my first dive into DOM manipulation, exploring how to select elements, make them do my bidding, and create an interactive menu, all without once yelling “Abracadabra!”

The Journey:

Getting Started: First up, I grabbed that <main> element and gave it a makeover(actually it was preset from CodeSandBox🤫).Not gonna lie, it felt like redecorating a room...but with JavaScript.

Creating a Menu Bar: Centeredthe navigation bar with a cool flex-around style, because if you’re going to have a menu, it better be a good-looking one.

Adding Menu Buttons: Here’s where things got interactive. I looped through an array (feeling like a pro-ish) to create menu links dynamically based on some pre-defined data. It’s basically a DIY menu generator.

Real Talk:
Sooooo, confession: I didn't save my files properly the first time (lesson learned the hard way, I know!). But now I’ve got everything saved, checked, and ready to go. Console’s been checked for errors, my comments are in place (and a little cheeky, just how I like them), and every line of code does what it’s supposed to.

Key Takeaway:
This was my crash course in making JavaScript work for me, and I’m pretty sure it was an even split between magic and logic. I now have a newfound appreciation for all things DOM.
